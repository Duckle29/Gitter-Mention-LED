# Gitter Mention LED

This script will listen in on a gitter room, and light up an LED when the selected username gets mentioned.
The script only tracks the last mention, to limit calls to the API.

Use your personal token for the token, as this is needed to automatically clear the unread status
Find your token [here](https://developer.gitter.im/apps)
